While it can be scary, knowing your status \u00ad whether it is positive or negative \u00ad is the first step to being healthy. The earlier you know your status, the better too.\r\n\r\nThese days, most health centres will offer HIV testing. They will also provide counselling about how to stay negative or what to do if you are positive.\r\n\r\nTo find the places close to you that offer testing: **TAYOA: Send a text to 15017 or call the National Health Helpline (117); PASADA: call: +255-222865451**\r\n\r\nNext Question:\r\n",
